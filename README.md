#GitMap (Work in Progress)
##Description
GitMap creates a map of a git repository, showing all the commits of each branch. 
The map will be saved in a plain text file with the name of (TBD). 
The map will show the author, date, and message of each commit. 
The information of each commit is contained within a box. 
Currently, the box will look like 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_		
Author: Name of Author		
Date: Date of commit    		
Commit Message		
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_		

The commits at the top of the file refer to the most recent commits. 
The box points upward to show the next/more recent commit. 
An arrow pointing to the side from the commit message means the branch has ended.
An example would be

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

##Warning
Commit all changes to the repository before running this program. 
All uncommited changes will be reverted to the last commit.

##Downloading and Running
To download, run the command:    
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ykamo001/GitMap  
$ . GitMap/GitMap.sh PathToYourGitRepo 
```
If no PathToYourGitRepo is passed in such as
```
$ . PathToGitMap/GitMap.sh
```
The script will run on the current directory.

#Errors
* When run on a directory that is not a git repository, 
the screen will output 
```
fatal: Not a git repository 
(or any parent up to mount point /homeDirectory)    
Stopping at filesystem boundary 
(GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).   
wc: ./RandomTempFileName/master: No such file or directory    
bash: [: 0: unary operator expected

```

##Examples


##Bugs and Issues
* Running the program will create a file with a random, 3-lettered name
* Boxes aren't fully completed yet
* If the folder isn't a git repository, our script will still try to run and an empty file will be created
* When run, the screen will output 
`Switched to branch \'exampleBranch\'` 
for every branch in the git repository

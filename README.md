#GitMap (Work in Progress)
##Description
GitMap creates a map of a git repository, showing all the commits of each branch. 
The map will be saved in a plain text file with the name of (TBD). 
The map will show the author, date, and message of each commit. 
The information of each commit is contained within a box. 
Currently, the box will look like 

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-		
Author: Name of Author		
Date: Date of commit    		
Commit Message		
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-		

The commits at the top of the file refer to the most recent commits. 
The box points upward to show the next/more recent commit. 
An arrow pointing to the side from the commit message means the branch has ended.
An example would be

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
